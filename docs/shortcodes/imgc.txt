NAME
       imgc - handle responsive images with Low-Quality Image Placeholders 
       (LQIP) for a better user experience

SYNOPSIS
       {{< imgc src="example.jpg" alt="An example image" >}}

DESCRIPTION
       This shortcode generates a responsive image with Low-Quality Image 
       Placeholders (LQIP) to enhance the user experience. It creates a `picture`
       element with multiple sources for different image formats and sizes, 
       ensuring optimal quality and performance.

PARAMETERS
       src
           The path to the image file within the assets/images directory. 
           (string)

       alt
           The alt text for the image, which is important for accessibility. 
           (string)

EXAMPLES
       Example usage of the shortcode:
              {{< imgc src="example.jpg" alt="An example image" >}}

       This will generate the following HTML:
              <div class="relative bg-center" style="background: 
              url(data:image/jpeg;base64,...); background-size: cover; 
              background-repeat: no-repeat;">
                <picture>
                  <source type="image/webp" srcset="/path/to/image-300.webp 
                  300w, /path/to/image-450.webp 450w, ..." sizes="(min-width: 
                  1024px) 100vw, 50vw" />
                  <source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/path/to/image-300.jpg 
                  300w, /path/to/image-450.jpg 450w, ..." sizes="(min-width: 
                  1024px) 100vw, 50vw" />
                  <img class="w-full h-auto animate-fade" 
                  src="/path/to/image-600.jpg" width="originalWidth" 
                  height="originalHeight" alt="An example image" loading="lazy" />
                </picture>
              </div>

EXPLANATION
       Breakpoints
              The shortcode uses predefined breakpoints to generate multiple image
              sizes for different screen widths.

       Base Image Path
              Images are located in the assets/images directory.

       LQIP
              Generates a 20-pixel-wide low-quality image placeholder, which is 
              encoded in Base64 and used as the background for a div, providing a 
              preview while the full image loads.

       Fallback Image
              A 600-pixel-wide JPG image is created as a fallback for browsers that 
              do not support the picture element.

       Picture Element
              Contains source elements for WebP and JPG formats, with srcset
              attributes for responsive images, ensuring the browser loads the most 
              appropriate image size and format.

       Cloudflare Pages Conditional
              If the site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, the LQIP background is 
              handled via a CSS class instead of inline styling to comply with 
              strict Content Security Policies (CSP).
